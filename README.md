# Udacity VR: 5th project - Night_Museum
This is 5th project for Udacity's VR Nanodegree. This mobile virtual reality experience with the topic 
of 'Space' obtained the basic idea and knowledge from the VR application company such as FUERO Games 
company with Samsung VR. Base on the research on VR companies and applications, the main theme of my 
Night Museum VR project is Hologram based VR experience to get educational knowledge from Solar System.

## Night Museum: providing 5 kind topics based information booths with VR.
This is an Aerospace Museum consists of 5 kinds of stations. Each station provides educational information
regarding Solar systems with 8 planets.

# Design and Development
## Persona: a typical user
I assume the target audience of this museum VR user, as the followings:
* **Hilary Lee**, 12, a Girl, Middle School student.
> Hilary is very excited to play a mobile game at these days.Especially she loves to learn something from VR. 
  She thinks it is easy to understand something both unvisual and untouchable stuff related information thru 
  VR clearly sometimes.
  
## Each station layout with UI sketches
There are 5 stations in the Museum. I initially desinged each station with the following layout order: 
* Station 1. **Solar System**
* Station 2. **Satellite with EARTH**
* Station 3. **Space Shuttle**
* Station 4. **Project MARS**
* Station 5. **Cinema Hole**

During building up Solar System's animation, such animation was too big to fit into the station 1 layout in 
the Museum. I revised the initial design with enhanced the layout with the order of each station as the followings:
* Station 1. **Satellite with EARTH**
* Station 2. **Space Shuttle**
* Station 3. **Project MARS**
* Station 4. **Cinema Hole**
* Station 5. **Solar System**, The animation will perform at the sky of the station 5.

## Story of this process
The user is able to navigate any station in the Aerospace Museum by following waypoints. These waypoints take 
the user to move from a station to another station after watching videoes. The user is able to play and pause 
any video by clicking the screen in each station.

# Breakdown of each station
## Station 1. **Satellite with EARTH**
There is a Satellite showcase with a media to play in the Station 1. The user is able to play and pause the media anytime.
* The name of video is "Solar System 101" from NASA.
